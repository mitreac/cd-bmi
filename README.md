# BMI change effects of biological pathways

This is a repository for code that performs the analysis of sequential expression data to evaluate the impact of BMI change on biological pathways from the Keyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG).

To run this code you would need an expression data matrix with genes on the rows and MI groups on the columns.
The cd_BMI.R script will bbe used to process the file.
As is, the code is set up to process two sets of files - it does the analysis of two datasets, the ER+ (estrogen receptor positive) breast cancer dataset and the TN (triple negative) breast cancer dataset.

Please contact the author Cristina Mitrea (mitrea@umich.edu) for questions related to the code.
